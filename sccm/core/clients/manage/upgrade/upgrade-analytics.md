# Integrate Upgrade Analytics with System Center Configuration Manager

Upgrade Analytics enables you to assess and analyze device readiness and compatibility with Windows 10, to allow easier and smoother upgrades. Integrate Upgrade Analytics with Configuration Manager to access client upgrade compatibility data in the Configuration Manager admin console. You'll then be able to target devices for upgrade or remediation from the device list.

Upgrade Analytics is a solution in the Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS). You can read more about Upgrade Analytics in [Get started with Upgrade Analytics](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/deploy/upgrade-analytics-get-started).

## Configure clients 

There are several configuration steps that you have to take to ensure that your clients can provide data to Upgrade Analytics:

-  Configure client telemetry settings as described in [Configure Windows telemetry in your organization](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organization).
-  Install the KBs described in the *Deploy the compatibility update and related KBs *section of [Get started with Upgrade Analytics](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/deploy/upgrade-analytics-get-started).

	> [!NOTE]
	> You can download a script to automate many of the client setup tasks. See the *Run the Upgrade Analytics deployment script* section of [Get started with Upgrade Analytics](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/deploy/upgrade-analytics-get-started) for information about the script. 

## Create a connection to Upgrade Analytics

### Prerequisites

- In order to add the connection, your Configuration Manager environment must first configure a [service connection point](../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md) in an [online mode](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/). When you add the connection to your environment, it will also install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on the machine running this site system role.
- Register Configuration Manager as a “Web Application and/or Web API” management tool, and get the [client ID from this registration](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-integrating-applications/).
- Create a client key for the registered management tool in Azure Active Directory.
- In the Azure Management Portal, provide the registered web app with permission to access OMS, as described in [Provide Configuration Manager with permissions to OMS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/log-analytics-sccm/#provide-configuration-manager-with-permissions-to-oms).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
	> When configuring permission to access OMS, be sure to choose the **Contributor** role, and assign it permissions to the resource group of the registered app. 

### Create the connection

1.  In **Administration** > **Cloud Services** > **Upgrade Analytics Connector**, choose **Create Connection to Upgrade Analytics** to start the **Add Upgrade Analytics Connector wizard**. 
3.  On the **Azure Active Directory** screen, provide **Tenant**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret Key**, then select **Next**.
4.  On the **Upgrade Analytics** screen, provide your connection settings by filling in your **Azure subscription**, **Azure resource group**, and **Operations Management Suite Workspace**.
5.  Verify your connection settings on the **Summary** screen, then select **Next**. 

	> [!NOTE]
	> You must connect Upgrade Analytics to the top-tier site in your hierarchy. If you connect Upgrade Analytics to a standalone primary site and then add a central administration site to your environment, you must delete and recreate the OMS connection within the new hierarchy.

6.  After you have linked Configuration Manager to Upgrade Analytics add the UpgradeAnalytics service to the workspace.
7.	Generate a commercial ID.
8.	Subscribe to Upgrade Analytics.

## Viewing Microsoft Upgrade Analytics properties in Configuration Manager

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Services**, then select **OMS Connector** to open the **OMS Connection Properties** page.
2.  Within this page there are two tabs:
  * The **Azure Active Directory** tab shows your **Tenant**, **Client ID**, **Client secret key expiration**, and allows you to **Verify** your **Client secret key** if it has expired.
  * The **OMS Connection Properties** tab shows your **Azure subscription**, **Azure resource group**, **Operations Management Suite Workspace**, and a list of **Device collections that Operations Management Suite can get data for**. Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to modify which collections are allowed.
